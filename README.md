This platform serves as an intermediary between NGOs and donors, simplifying the donation process. Donors can offer specific items for donation, and NGOs can coordinate pickups, ensuring efficient and seamless operations.

Workflow:

User Registration/Login:
User selects their role (NGO/Donor) during registration. Role-specific data is stored in corresponding tables.

Donor Creates a Request:
Donor selects an item type and submits the request. The system stores the request and notifies NGOs.

NGO Coordinates Pickup:
NGOs log in to view donation requests. NGOs accept a request and specify a pickup time and location. The system notifies the donor of the details.

Status Tracking:
Donors and NGOs can view the current status of the donation. The NGO marks the request as "Completed" after pickup. The system updates the status and notifies both parties.
